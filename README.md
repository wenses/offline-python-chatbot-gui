Make sure you have ollama installed
due to my limited pc specs, this script utilizes gemma 2b 
use this command to ensure the gemma 2b model is within your pc 
``` ollama run gemma:2b ```
to install other needed python libraries you can either run 
``` python install_stuff.py ``` (usually for windows)
for linux 
``` python3 install_stuff.py ```
if you would like to use pip 
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
Then run the chatbot gui by running
``` python chatbot_gui.py ```
